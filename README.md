# ETG-Inentory-Management-System.

This is an Inventory Mangagement System. In this, I have uploaded three files namely--
1.record.json
2.sales.json
3.Inventory Mangement System Source Code.ipynb


In the record.json file, there are more than 50 items stored, out of which a user purcahses any item.

After the purchase, the record.json file gets updated with the new quantity(as the quantity updates after successful purchase).

There are various attributes of the product like ProductID, Name, Manufacturing Date, Expiry Date, Price, Discount and many more.

The user purchases a given product using the ProductID.

The sales.json file also gets updated which keeps track of all the purchases. This file stores all the sales data.



Hope, you find it useful!

Thank You!!
